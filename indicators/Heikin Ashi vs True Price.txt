//This indicator shows the difference between the real open and heikin ashi open.
//This is useful for seeing how strong the percent difference between them is.
//ONLY WORKS ON NORMAL CANDLE CHART

study("Heikin Ashi vs True Price")

//setting variables, heikin ashi close and heikin ashi open
hac = (open + high + low + close) / 4
hao = na(hao[1]) ? (open + close) / 2 : (hao[1] + hac[1]) / 2

//set variable dif to percent difference between heikin ashi open and actual open.
dif = (hao - open) / abs(open) * 100

//plot dif variable
plot(dif, style=columns, color=aqua)

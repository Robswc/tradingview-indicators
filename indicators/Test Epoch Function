// This is a useful little function that can be used as a condition.  For example.
// Say you only want to signal a "buy" only during certain hours.  You can do this by
// adjusting the hours on this function and using it as a condition. I.e.
// if condition_a AND condition_b AND test_epoch()
//      strategy.enter

test_epoch() =>
    test_start_hour = input(0)
    test_stop_hour = input(9)
